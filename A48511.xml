            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Mr.</hi> Lillies <hi>Predictions</hi> Concerning the many lamentable Fires which have lately happened, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe many ſad and lamentable Fires that have lately broke forth or happened about this Honourable City of <hi>London,</hi> and in ſeveral other parts and places of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, have for ſome time by-paſt been the Common Theme of moſt Peoples Diſcourſe: but as 'tis uſual for every one to abound in his own ſenſe, and natural for thoſe under affliction to aſcribe the cauſe of their ſufferings to others, ſo on this occoſion many ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Reports and ſurmiſes have been ſpread abroad; We confeſs that by all we can diſcover, (and we have been not a little curious and inquiſitive in the matter) we cannot poſitively find any ſolid bottom for ſuch Conjectures; and therefore many look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe diſaſters as chaſtizements from Providence for our ſins, proceeding from what we call unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate accidents, and occaſion'd by neglects, careleſneſs,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32865:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 97 -->
&amp;c. As the proximate and immediate cauſes, though we will not deny, but rather affirm that there might be and were ſeveral others more remote contributing unto, or at leaſt ſignifying and fore-ſhewing the ſame or the like Calamities, and that not onely in this Nation, but in ſeveral other parts of the <hi>European</hi> world.</p>
            <p>It muſt be remembred, that the Inhabitants of this Earthly Globe have for ſeveral years paſt, and do at this preſent labour under the effects; or Male-ſignifications of the Comet or Comets (whether ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular or three diſtinctions we ſhall not here diſpute) appearing in the years 1664. and 1665. Sure we are, the laſt viſible in <hi>March</hi> 1665. had a Tail eminently large and conſpicuous, and tovvards the end of it's appearance looked very red, fiery, and inflam'd, &amp;c. Which (beſides its martial ſignifications whereof all <hi>Europe</hi> has been ſadly ſenſible) did likewiſe very apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denote many ſtrange and unuſual calamities by fire, (whereof the dreadful conflagration of <hi>London</hi> ſoon after following was a ſad and amazing Inſtance.) Nor can it be reaſonably imagined the effects of ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful a <hi>Phaiomenon</hi> ſhould terminate in one ſingle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter though never ſo eminent.</p>
            <p>In this very year 1076. we have had diverſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and threatning poſitions and aſpects of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior bodies, enough to bring into act more of it's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſignifications, as the Conjunction of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars, Jan.</hi> 15. The ſquare of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars, Feb.</hi> 23. of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and the <hi>Sun, March</hi> 28.

            <p>We now dare challenge the greateſt calumniators of aſtrology to declare, what more could be expected from an Artiſts Pen to this purpoſe, (not pretending to ſupernatural illumination) than theſe repeated and ſo oft inculcated predictions; and how far they are (already) verified, is too ſadly apparent by the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Catalogue of Diſmal fires which (pinch beyond what is uſual) have ſince the writing thereof happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, omitting a great number of ſmaller fires whereby only 1 or 2 houſes chanc'd to be conſumed, and inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on what has been more general and remarkable.</p>

            <p>On Saturday the 29 of <hi>April</hi> 1676. about 10 of the clock in the morning at a noted Village called <hi>Cotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> within four miles of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in the Road to <hi>Ely</hi> broke forth a dreadful fire, beginning in a Stack of courſe ſedge whereunto the Wind had carried ſome Embers by a certain woman careleſly flung into a back-ſide, and from thence the flames were carried by the violence of the wind all along the ſtreet, ſo that in the ſpace of five hours there were above one hundred Dwelling-houſes conſumed, beſides Barns, Stables, out-houſes, Stacks of Corn, Hay, Faggots,

            <p>In a word, all along on the Eaſt-ſide of the way, from the Queens-Arms-Tavern, Scituate about a Dozen Doors below the Spurt-Inn towards the South, unto St. <hi>Thomas Haſpital</hi> towards the North was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, but the Hoſpital ſafe; onely ſome ſmall damage ſuſtained in the Porch, Windows, &amp;c. And on the Weſt-ſide of the way, from St. <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets-hill,</hi> to St. <hi>Saviours</hi> (Commonly called St. <hi>Mary Overies</hi>) Church: which Church was with extraordinary pains, and great difficulty preſerved; There is modeſtly computed at the leaſt ſix hundred dwelling houſes deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>The ſame day happened a Fire at <hi>Abington</hi> in <hi>Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> which burning very fiercely, deſtroyed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Houſes, and had it not pleaſed God that the wind ſuddenly changed, 'tis believed the whole Town had been conſumed, but by that ſingular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and the great induſtry uſed, it was preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the Fire in ſhort time Extinguiſhed.</p>

               <!-- PDF PAGE 99  -->About the ſame time the Town of <hi>Blandford</hi> in <hi>Sommerſetſhire,</hi> was a conſiderable part burnt down to the ground, there being (as we ſtand informed) about thirty dwelling houſes there conſumed.</p>
            <p>The beginning of this inſtant month of <hi>June,</hi> a Fire began in a Barn in a Village called <hi>Wittham,</hi> two or three miles from <hi>Oxford:</hi> which deſtroyed about a dozen houſes, and had waſted many more, if great numbers of people had not ſpeedily come in to their aſsiſtance from <hi>Oxford;</hi> 'Tis ſaid that a day or two before, the Officers of this Village had ſet a certain Vagabond woman in the Stocks, for begging, or ſome other miſdemeanour, and that ſhe ſhould threaten that within four and twenty hours ſhe would be even with them, and make them repent it, &amp;c. and thereupon 'tis ſuppoſed that ſhe, or ſome of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates might miſchievouſly ſet this Barn on Fire, it being ſcarce to be imagined how it ſhould come on fire any other way.</p>
            <p>On Wedneſday the 21 of this inſtant <hi>June,</hi> there was a very conſiderable fire in <hi>Sun-Court</hi> in <hi>Nightingale-lane;</hi> it began in a Box-makers-houſe, and though immediately on the diſcovery of it there was thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ready to help quench it, yet it could not be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered till it had deſtroyed above Twenty Tenements.</p>
            <p>The ſame week alſo there has been ſeveral great Tempeſts of Thunder, with fierce and unuſual Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whereby three very large Stacks of old Hay were conſumed near <hi>Brainford,</hi> conſiderable hurt done near <hi>Putney,</hi> and great damage ſuſtained at ſeveral other places.</p>

            <p>Be pleaſed to take notice that there was in the City of <hi>Mosko</hi> a dreadful fire in <hi>April</hi> laſt, which laſted with much fury for the ſpace of Nine days, and in that ſpace burnt down to the ground above ſeaven Thouſand dwelling houſes, beſides Shops, Warehouſes, out-houſes, and other Edifices Innumerable: on the 29 of <hi>April</hi> it was thought to have been maſter'd and ſtopt, but about Eleven a clock that Night the Wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſtrong at North-weſt, it broke forth afreſh, the loſs ſuſtained is as well incredible as Invaluable and adds as to the begining of it: that 'tis ſuppoſed to be done by Fire-kindlers: There have been likewiſe ſeveral great fires in <hi>Germany,</hi> in <hi>May</hi> laſt, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Cities of <hi>Starguard</hi> (expreſly mentioned by Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi>) and new <hi>Branderburgh,</hi> belonging to his Electoral Highneſs, were then above half burnt down and conſumed, and divers great fires have likewiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame time happened in <hi>Burgundy, Picardy,</hi> and other parts of <hi>France.</hi>

            <p>We ſhall conclude this Paper with the words of Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> in his <hi>Aſtrological Iudgements</hi> before recited.—God Preſerve <hi>London,</hi> (and all his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Dominions) from further Fires, and Increaſe the Trade and Commerce therefore; <hi>Ad Infinitum: Amen.</hi>
